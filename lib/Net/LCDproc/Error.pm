L<Throwable::Error|Throwable::Error> based exception class. You should probably
read its documentation first, then come back here.

When C<Net::LCDproc> encounters an error, it will throw an exception you can catch, or not.

By default C<Throwable::Error> will provide the error message with a stack trace.
This module offers a few other options for you to choose from.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item C<class_name>

B<Required>. A string containing the name of the throwing class.

=item C<object>

Any blessed object, usually a copy of the throwing class' C<$self>.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<short_msg>

Returns a string containing the C<class_name> and the C<message>.

=item C<dump>

Returns a stringified C<< $self->object >>, using L<Data::Dumper|Data::Dumper>. If C<< $self->object >>
isn't set, returns a string saying so.
